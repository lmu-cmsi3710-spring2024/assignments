**CMSI 3710** Computer Graphics, Spring 2024

# Assignment 0221
Our last assignment before we plunge into our own 3D library is focused on having you spend some time on the primitive side of graphics, in order to gain an appreciation for what it takes to implement these lower-level graphics operations.

## Background Reading
The entire [Pixar in a Box](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/pixar) collection from Khan Academy is awesome, but in particular, you will want to look at these:
* [Color Science](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/pixar/color) as a whole provides some key background information on color
* [RGB color model](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/pixar/color/color-101/v/color-2) within that sequence, and its accompanying practice exercise, gives you the most direct information relating to this assignment

In the Shirley/Marscher textbook ([available on Brightspace](https://brightspace.lmu.edu/d2l/le/content/235198/viewContent/2897518/View)), you can get deeper treatment of this material and some future course content with _Chapter 3: Raster Images_.

To sharpen your “color intuition,” try out the [What the Hex](http://yizzle.com/whatthehex/) game.

And finally, if you want to learn more about the 2D drawing capabilities of the `canvas` element, try out this [tutorial from the Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial). There are also many other resources on `canvas` that can be found on the web.

## Primitives
The _primitives_ sample code shown in class is part of the starter code in this repository. It will be best to fully collaborate on this one as a group—try to spend a non-zero amount of time writing code together, in person or over a screenshare. Use commits, pulls, and pushes to keep everyone in sync. You don’t have to work this way _all_ of the time but you should spent _some_ time in this mode so that everyone can get in sync on how to write the code.

For this portion of the assignment, implement the following primitives-level operations. They may seem to vary in difficulty but they follow the same general pattern—which is part of the takeaway here 😁 Once you “crack” it, the actual code to write will consist of only a few lines. Remember, when actually painting a color, _only_ use the given `setPixel` function to simulate what happens at the raw graphics primitive level.

For these exercises, don’t worry about the usual primitive concern of minimizing operations and restricting calculations to just integers. Compute as needed, and with floating point arithmetic.

Make sure that the _Primitives_ section of the demo application visually and effectively demonstrates your enhanced implementations.

### Dye Hard: Two-Color Circle Fill
_Implement a linear two-color gradient for circles:_ Modify the circle functions and their `plotCirclePoints` helper in the _primitives_ module so that they accept _two_ colors and such that the circles get painted with a linear horizontal or vertical gradient (your choice) from the first color at the circles’s leftmost _x_- or uppermost _y_-coordinate to the second color at the circle’s right _x_- or bottom _y_-coordinate, respectively. Again, your group can decide whether to go horizontal or vertical.

_Hint:_ Figure out how to make `plotCirclePoints` fill the circle with a single color first. Note that the first couple of variations won’t look solid due to the way the coordinates are calculated.

### Dye Harder: Radial Gradient 🌈
_Implement a two-color radial gradient for rectangles:_ Modify the `fillRect` function in the _primitives_ module so that it interprets the first two colors (`c1` and `c2`), when present, as filling the given rectangle with a _radial gradient_ emanating from its center to the _smaller_ of its two dimensions.

For example, the radial gradient for a 100×40 rectangle will have a radius of 20 pixels; the radial gradient for a 30×98 rectangle will have a radius of 15 pixels.

Your new implementation may ignore the three- or four-color case: instead, just call the two-color case all the time, disregarding the extra color arguments.

_Hint:_ The overall structure of the fill does not have to change. It’s only the color calculation that needs modification.

### Dye Hard with a Vengeance: Multicolor Polygon Fill 🧠💫✨🧐
_Implement a multipoint linear gradient for polygons:_ Modify the `fillPolygon` function in the _primitives_ module so that its third argument is expected to be an _array_ of colors, one color per vertex. The resulting polygon should be filled such that each vertex is painted with exactly the color that positionally corresponds to it in the given arrays, with every other pixel transitioning smoothly across these colors.

Yes, this is not unlike the `vertexColors` feature in three.js geometry and material objects. No, this is not a coincidence 💡

_Hint:_ The approach to this gradient is similar to the one for the original four-color rectangle gradient. Calculate vertical gradients based on the vertices’ _y_-coordinates, then as the algorithm scans across a row of pixels, perform a horizontal gradient from the color on the left side to the color on the right.

_Protip:_ Because there should be a one-to-one correspondence between the vertices and colors, you’ll want to enhance the `Edge` object so that it holds the vertices _and_ the corresponding colors of each edge in the polygon.

## Image Processing Filters
The _nanoshop_ and _nanoshop-neighborhood_ sample code shown in class is also part of this repository’s starter code.

For this portion, _each group member must implement filters individually_. The group should coordinate with each other so that the filter buttons everyone’s work. You might want to change to a `select` element with an _Apply Filter_ button so that everything fits.

Thus, if your group has _n_ members, the final submission should have _n_ filters of each type.

### Live Free (of other pixels) or Dye Hard: Single-Pixel Filters
Add one (1) single-pixel filter of your own design, _per group member_, to the _nanoshop_ module. Modify the accompanying _NanoshopDemo_ component to use these new filters.

### A Good Day (in the neighborhood) to Dye Hard: Neighborhood-Pixel Filters
Add one (1) neighborhood-pixel filter of your own design, _per group member_, to the _nanoshop-neighborhood_ module. Modify the _NanoshopNeighborhoodDemo_ component to use these new filters.

Note you’ll end up with a grand total of _2n_ new filters, across the two types. For the _nanoshop-neighborhood_ additions, make sure that your filters _do_ use the neighborhood pixels when computing the filtered color. A “neighborhood” filter that bases its calculations solely on the central pixel will not get credit.

### Note: Yippee Ki Yay Mother Filter
To ensure that the filters aren’t solely simplistic derivatives of the samples (nor each other!), make sure to do one of the following:
* Perform _genuinely different_ computations—don’t just change up constants! (because that is more or less the same filter)
* **or** _parameterize_ the filters—i.e., refactor the code so that you have functions that _return_ filter functions. Here’s an example (which you therefore you can’t use as your own):

```javascript
const uniformScale = coefficient =>
  (x, y, r, g, b, a) => [r * coefficient, g * coefficient, b * coefficient, a]
```

Observe that this is a function that _creates_ variants of the `darken` filter, where the amount by which to brighten/darken a color is given by the `coefficient`.

## Extra Credit: Your Own 2D Canvas Drawing
You might recall that three.js creates a `canvas` element to do its 3D work. The image processing filter examples use the `canvas` element in _2D_ mode. All of the code is there (written by a former student) and if you like, you can write some new code so that the scene being drawn is different. By and large, the Mozilla Developer Network’s [`canvas` tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial) is enough to get a start.

Make sure that your drawing shows enough nuance and variety to show off the full functionality of the filters that you implement.

## How to Turn it In
Commit the following to your repository:
- Three (3) primitive enhancements
- One (1) single-pixel filter per group member, for a total of _n_ single-pixel filters for an _n_-member group
- One (1) neighborhood-pixel filter per group member, for a total of _n_ neighborhood-pixel filters an _n_-member group
- Corresponding modifications to the web application code that demonstrate these improvements effectively
- (optionally) Code that creates a different `canvas` image for the filters
